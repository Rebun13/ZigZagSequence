# ZigZagSequence

## Description

Given an array of _n_ distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first _k_ elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last _k_ elements are in decreasing order, where _k = (n + 1) / 2_. You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.

## Input

- The first line contains _y_ the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer _n_, denoting the number of array elements.
- The next line of the test case contains elements of array _a_.

## Output

- For each test cases, print the elements of the transformed zig zag sequence in a single line.
